## Project Vision

**The project is for:** _people who play video games, groups of friends, people who like social deduction games._

**Whose goal is to:** _satisfy the need on the market for alternative social deduction games with more unique mechanics and premises._

**The name of the project being:** _Burn Her!_

**It is a:** _multiplayer social deduction video game themed after witch trials and investigations._

**That:** _presents a highly replayable experience with unique mechanics, a strong theme and room for future expansion._

## Risk Plan

**Multiplayer functionality**

The risks involved with developing a stable multiplayer functionality are important to be aware of as the ability to play the game with other people is a must that needs to be delivered since the whole gameplay relies on it. The main difficulty in that regard will be my lack of previous experience with networking and developing multiplayer solutions. To make sure that a catastrophe is averted I will devote a significant amount of time for further research and experimentation early on in the project lifecycle in order to ensure that no shortcomings which sooner or later will arise hinder the base functionality in the later phase of the project when fixes and alterations will be more difficult to implement as a result of hitherto amount of code built up or a lack of time.

**Strong fundamental mechanics**

The game will require a really strong set of rules and fundamental gameplay mechanics for the experience to reach a highly replayable level. In a game such as this, being a social deduction game, a lot of are will need to be put towards making the game fair and balanced for all the players involved. They will generally have to work against each other to secure a victory, therefore creating an experience favouring a given party within the game will result in a negative player experience. I would of course like to claim that any such fears will surely be gotten rid of by a through planning and design work early on, however truth be told, it will not be possible. Instead, I expect for many changes to be implemented throughout the lifecycle of the project. This will require an extensive amount of player testing in order to find out what will provide the most fair and entertaining experience for the likely players. I&#39;ve already secured a large group of people who will be able to aid me with my endeavours.

**Planning/Timing shortfalls**

An obvious risk that always needs to be faced relates to bad judgement in regard to time allocation and planning. If the sprints won&#39;t be achieved or if the planning for the sprints will not be extensive enough the project will eventually end up impossible to be completed within the given time frame and so either amount of content or quality will need to be hindered in order to bring the project to a close before the deadline. To avoid this, the best course of action would be to maintain an open mindset towards frequent updating and developing of the backlog so that the realisation of the project not being completed in time comes much sooner than it would otherwise.
